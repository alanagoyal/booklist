Authors, entrepreneurs, and cultural figures demonstrate broader genre engagement compared to engineers or product managers.

This reflects how roles deeply involved in cultural production or intellectual discourse are likely to explore a more diverse literary spectrum, using literature as a tool for creative inspiration and intellectual exploration. Conversely, engineers and technologists might focus their reading on genres directly pertinent to their specialized professional knowledge.
